Troubleshooting process

- go to the http site in question,
    after it redirects to the https equivalent and it times out,
    observe the message displayed on the browser
- if message implies that the webpage has a redirect loop or too many redirects
    - go to the https site directly and ensure that this works
    - clear the cache and cookies and reload page (to remove the possibility that this is an issue with the browser)
    - if error persists
        - go to the config file specifying the security group of the app in .ebextension
            - ensure that the following is true for the elastic load balancer
                - Listens on port 80 (HTTP) and proxy it to EC2 instance port 80 (HTTP)
                - Listens on port 443 (HTTPS) and proxy it to EC2 instance port 80 (HTTP) or port 1433 (HTTP)
        - go to the nginx config of the app
            - ensure that nginx is bound to listen on port 80 and 443
            - ensure that a rule that does the following is added to observe the X_FORWARDED_PROTO value in the header of the load balancer:
                - ensures that when a request arrives at port 80 on the load balancer, it is forwarded to port 443 as a permanent redirect
                - ensures that when a request arrives at port 443, the request is served (it is neither forwarded or redirected)
- else, ensure that the app is breathing by checking the health check. If it rejects the HTTP:80 because of the 301 redirect, change it to HTTP:1433
- clear the cache and cookies and try again
